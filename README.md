# BLiP plugin

BLiP plugin it's a technology-agnostic way to plug unnoficial features to enhance the portal capabilities.

This project aims to give the initial skill needed to develop and build your own plugins.

## Getting started from sample

This sample was made using the React framework.

1. Download or clone the project from `git`(the recommended way):

`git clone https://github.com/takenet/blip-plugin-sample.git`

2. Install all packages from npm:

`cd sample && npm install`

3. Run the project:

`npm start`

4. Now just add the plugin to your chatbot and enjoy!

## Good to know

* All the communication between your plugin and portal should be made using the browser message API. We highly recommend you to use our official [package][iframe-message] which was been designed to that communication.
* We recomend you to create plugins with components and colors similar to our design system, we have a official [package][blip-toolkit] to help with that.
* After the first render of plugin, if the window size is too small, you will have to change it through the `HeightChange` message.
* We have some guidelines to create new pages, we recommend you to follow their(it's in portuguese):
